for loops
&&&&&&&&&
iterate over a sequence 

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
for x in nums: 
  print(x)  
  # where x is the block variable

word = "banana"
for x in word: 
  print(x)

BREAK, CONTINUE, ELSE 

run a specific number of times 
for x in range(10):
  print(x)

for x in range(101, 103):
  print(x)
  # only runs bewteen 101, 102, and 103

for x in range(10, 20, 2):
  print(x)
  # third variable is the increment value. this would only display even numbers

nested loops are fine
can use PASS - why?
for x in range(20)
  pass

REVERSE
for x in range(10, 0, -1)
for x in range(start, stop, step)

ITERATE WITH INDEX
a = 'abcd'
for i, x in enumerate(a):
  ...
