functions or methods?
----------
def function():
  print("THIS")

def function2(arg):
  print(f'THIS {arg}')

if the number of args is not knowns, use *arg 

def function3(*val):
  print(f'look at all these {args})

need to use a `return` statement 
anyhting after the return WILL NOT RUN

__init__ is like def intialize 

class create_person():
  def __init__ (self, name, address, phone)
    self.name = name 
    self.address = address 
    self.phone = phone 
  
MULTIPLE RETURNS 
  def fxn(a, b):
    x = a+b 
    y = a-b 
    return x,y 
  
  i = fxn(1,2)
  >> (3,-1) type = tupple
  i,j = fxn(1,2)
  >>  3 type = int 
  >> -1 type = int


dont use empty lists as default objects. it'll compound
