math operators 
------------
** = exponent
// = floor division (round down) 99//10 = 9
                                  9//10 = 0
+=
-=
*-
/=
%=
//=
**=
&= --> x &= 3 --> x = x & 3
|= --> x |= 3 --> x = x | 3
^+
>> --> bit shift 
<< --> bit shift (2<<1 = 4(10), 2<<2 = 8(100))

== equal 
!= not equal
>=
<=

can use 'and' 'or' 'not'
can use 'is' x is y --> are x and y equal?
can use 'in' x in y --> does x exisit inside the array, string, hash of y
