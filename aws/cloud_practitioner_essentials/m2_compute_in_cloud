Amazon elastic compute cloud - EC2 
----------------------------------
raw compute capacity 
need servers
aws servers are virtual 
flexible, cost effective, quick
long time to get it up and running 
delivery, installation, rack and stack, etc... = long time 

with aws..
not stuck with servers you dont need
only pay for running instances, not stopped or terminated
sharing host with other instances (virtual machine)
hypervisor - responsible for coordinating the mulitenancy - managed by aws 
mulitenancy - sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines 

EC2 instances are secure even though they share
  - instances are unaware 
  - choose windows or linux for EC2 config
  - you choose software 
  - resizable - virtual scaling
  - control the networking aspect (requests) public or private 
  - ease of provisioning
  - Compute as a Service (CaaS)

Launch, Connect, Use

EC2 Instances 
-------------
  - grouped by instance family
  - varied types of CPU, storage, networking capactiy
    - general purpose 
      - balanced
      - gaming 
      - backend for enterprise 
      - small and medium dbs
    - compute optimized 
      - high performance processors
      - gaming
      - web
      - scientific modeling
    - memory optimeized 
      - ideal for high-performance databases
      - lots of data that needs to be loaded
      - memory is temp space, programs are loaded from storage into memory
      - big db 
    - accelerated computing - floating points, pattern, graphing
    - storage optimized
      - suituble for data warehousing
      - high sequential read and write access ot large datasets
      - input / output per second (IOPS)

EC2 Pricing 
-----------
  - on-demand
    - short term, irregular
    - cant be interuppted
  - savings 
    - low prices in exchange for consistent usage
    - 1-year or 3-year 
    - 72% less than on-demand
  - reserved instances 
    - 75% off for a big term (1-3 years)
    - at the end of the term its on-demand unless you terminate, or purcahse a new one
  - spot instances 
    - aws an take it back. 2 min warning 
    - batch workloads 
    - flexible start and end times
    - use unsued EC2s
    - 90% off
    - background worker
    - not always available
    - no contract/commitment
  - dedicated hosts - physical hosts 
    - usually for regulations
