----------------------------------
subnets - rage of ip address in my VPC
public subnet 
private subnet 
your own private virtual network 
  - place stuff inside 
  - place them in specific subnets 
  - authorization 

Public facing resources 
  - attatch an itnernet gateway 
    - IGW 

Private facing resources 
  - no internet gateway 
  - private gateway 
    - coming from an approved gateway 
    - virtual private gateway 
      - authentication 
      - encrypted 
  - direct doorways 
  - dedicated 
  - lowest amount of latency 
  - highest amount of security 
AWS DIRECT CONNECT ^^^
  - physical line (fiber)
  - help meet regulatory needs 


VPC 
---
network services from aws
  - network hardening
  - app security 
  - user identity 
  - authentication and authorization 
  - distributed denial of service prevention 
  - data integrity 
  - encryption

Network Hardening 
  - subnets ?
    - control access to gateways 
    - private subnets to not 
  - packet = message from internet 
    - Network ACL
    - packets are checked against network access control list (ACL)
      - permission to enter or leave 
    - check traffic 
  - need instance level security as well 
    - security groups 
    - by default, all traffic is rejected 
    - doesnt check on the way out 
      - all traffic can leave
SECURITY GROUP 
  - stateful (remember)
  - all can exit 
  - inner
  - EC2 instances
  - virtual firewall
NETWORK ACL
  - stateless (dont remember)
  - outer
  - subnets
  - default allow everything in and out

GLOBAL NETWORKING 
-----------------
Route 53 
  - DNS
  - translation service 
  - name >>> ip address 
  - direct traffic to differnt endpoints 
    - latency based 
    - geolocation DNS 
      - direct traffic baed on where traffic is located
    - geoproximity routing 
    - weighted round robin

Amazon CloudFront
