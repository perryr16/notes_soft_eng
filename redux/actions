Actions: 
   - JS object 
   - MUST HAVE A 'type' w/ string value 
   - typically a 'payload'
   - When an action is called its 'DISPATCHED'
   - examples:
      const action1 = {
         type: 'todos/addTodo',
         payload: 'Walk',
      }
      const action2 = {
         type: 'todos/removeAll'
      }
      const action3 = {
         type: 'todos/removeTodo',
         payload: 'Pack snacks'
      }
