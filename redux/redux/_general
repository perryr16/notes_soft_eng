 REDUX in GENERAL 
******************
shared data is the state of the app 
process of sharing and updating state is STATE MANAGEMENT 

REDUX is a State Management Library 
   - follows Flux Architeture
   - data stored in a single object 
   - data not stored in components 
   - components can request data through `actions`

similar tools:
   - Recoil, MobX, Apollo Client

3 parts:
   - State - the data (model)
   - View - UI (view)
   - Actions - events to chagne state (controller - not really)

State: 
   - any data type 

Actions: 
   - JS object 
   - MUST HAVE A 'type' w/ string value 
   - typically a 'payload'
   - When an action is called its 'DISPATCHED'
   - examples:
      const action1 = {
         type: 'todos/addTodo',
         payload: 'Walk',
      }
      const action2 = {
         type: 'todos/removeAll'
      }
      const action3 = {
         type: 'todos/removeTodo',
         payload: 'Pack snacks'
      }
