npm link 
npm-link 

symlink - 'symbolic' or 'soft' link. Similar to a shortcut. A file that points to another file
  - like a windows shortcut

`npm link` in a package folder will create a symlink in the global folder (`/lib.node_modules/<package>`)
this will link the package to where the npm link command was executed 
`cd <package dir>`
`npm link` // creates a symlink to the global folder
`npm link <@scope>/<pkg>` // creates symlink from globally installed package to node_modules 
aka 
`npm link @mile-hi-labs/react-data`

note: bin = binary = executables

From Freddy: 
  'You remove the @mile-hi-labs/react-data line from the package.json file 
  and then run npm install. That removes react-data from the demo project. 
  Then, you run npm link from root (that creates a local symlink to the package 
  on your machine) then you run npm link @mile-hi-labs/react-data from the demo 
  project directory (linking the demo to the src package)'
