DOCKER VS vagrant

well what is vagrant 
--------------------
works on my machine, doesnt work in production or someone elses.
enviormnets are not the same! 
vagrant saves settings in a virtual enviroment and then push that to github 


DOCKER 
-------
run off containers 
dockerfiles are small (20 lines)
dockerfiles build docker images 
docker image contains project code, installation of node.js, installments of programs, complete project image. designed to sit ontop of a machine 
VM contains docker image, run an image as a container, can run as many containers as I want

dont put code in enviroments, actually build enviorments
if I have docker on my machine, it will work. if you have docker on your machine, it will work
docker image is saved to docker hub (like github )

apps run as docker containers
