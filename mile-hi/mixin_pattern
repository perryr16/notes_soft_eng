-or-

and 
const refreshData = () => {
  setShowForm(false);
  fetchData();
}

FormMixin
==========

similar to store helpers (util)
- remove formMixin from 'extends Components'
- import { } from 'utils/store-helpers';
- if a method is being used, bring it in. remove 'this' from the method
-
FormMixins is equal to utils/helpers
