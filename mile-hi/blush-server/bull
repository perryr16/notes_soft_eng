BULL
====
a node LIBRARY that implements a queue system based on REDIS 
can use Redis alone, but bull takes care of low-level detials
allows for more complex uses
USES: 
  - smoothing process peaks
  - creating robust comm channels between microservices 
  - offloading heavy work from one server to many others

next version is written in TypeScript

usage:
-------
`job.data` contains the custom data passed when the job was created
we dont use 'done();' becuase its a promise 

can have 3 main roles but usually divided into different instances
  - job producer 
  - job consumer 
  - event listener
  
queues provide async communication

add a job. a job is just a JS object
