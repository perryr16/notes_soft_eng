------------------
moving blush towards dmc 
function over class

adapters = building of url

context = higher order component 
can use apis from anywhere
maintians its own state 

server side rendered = better for search egnienrs - SEO search engine opt
vs client side rendered

index > app > 

routes handled by a router file 

store: handles global state of app


! hooks !
moving away from class and to function

migrate the components directory

move away from imports, to iecxports

dashboard - activities, activity list, 

basics are bootstrap

all model based except

app-section is good

alphabetical is prefered

route - loader - list
route - list - card 

state v props

** const { constructor stuff } = props;
also values that are passed in from the dashboard component 
  i.e. <AlalyiticsPreview 
          type='preview'
          provider={provider}
        />
  provider was used in this case

  component is used with class
  useEffect useState is used with functions 
  useEffect like componentDidMount

  this.prop not needed in a functional component
isLoading > loading
