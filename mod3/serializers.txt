serializers replace the need for views, if we have APIs

when we make the call
render json: 
rails makes the call
as_json unless we have seriizlsers
as_json then calls to_json and repsonse is generated
lets customize what gets sent back

to iterate through each object in the JSON response do the following
if there is an order with many items 

> attribute :num_items do |object|
    object.items.count 
  end  
where `object` is similar to self and represents each reponse item 

in controller
-------------
def index 
  render json: ModelSerializer.new(Model.all)
end
def show 
  render json: ModelSerializer.new(Model.find(params[:id]))
end

???--QUESTIONS--??? 
serializer turns it into serial and then back to JSON?
