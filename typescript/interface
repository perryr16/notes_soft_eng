TYPE VS INTERFACE

TYPE: 
   type Mail = {
   postagePrice: number;
   address: string;
   }
   
   const catalog: Mail = ...

INTERFACE: (no '=' sign) 
- only for use on OBJECTS (classes are objects)
   interface Mail {
      postagePrice: number;
      address: string;
   }

   const catalog: Mail = ...

INTERFACE WITH CLASSES: 'implements'
   interface Robot {
      identify: (id: number) => void;
   }
   
   class OneSeries implements Robot {
   identify(id: number) {              // MUST HAVE AN idenfity method AS DECLARED BY INTERFACE
      console.log(`beep! I'm ${id.toFixed(2)}.`);
   }
   
   answerQuestion() {                  // but add as many new methods as you like
      console.log('42!');
      }
   }
