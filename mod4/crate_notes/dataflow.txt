Login
-------
page: /web/src/modules/pages/home.js
note: there are several paths: '/crates --> redirects to login
routes: user/login, user/singup, user/profile, user/subscriptions
click login

page: DNE. its pulling from /modules/user/login.js 
if username is bad: /api/src/modules/user/resolvers.js
hits `if (!user)` and throws error 
this is represented in login.js by `this.props.messageShow(this.props.user.error)`

Success:
where is the redirection happening to /crates?
at bottom there is <AuthCheck/> which is hitting the import AuthCheck
in AuthCheck if it is successufl 
admin: admin.dashboard.path = '/admin/dashboard'
user: crate.list.path = '/crates'

Crates:
populated from an import of List from /modules/crate/list
I'd love to be able to see all the values in here
pulling crates from `this.props.crates.list`
if there are `this.props.crates.list` then it will map over the length and create 'CrateItems'
follow CrateItems to './Item'
onClickSubscribe crateId is set (clothes for men = 1, clothes for women = 2)
where is a subscription created?
'create' imported from 'subscriptions/api/actions'
this.props.create()
create is a mutation attatched through resolvers
create is a resolver that finally looks familiar.



*** SIDE NOTE *** 
imports are the key to all of this
feels like a controller scenario where we dont want to import to much
/ 

*** SIDE NOTE *** 
what is `this`?
has the following structure
{
context
props: crates, history, location, match
refs:
state: null 
updater:
_reactInternalFiber:
_reactInternalInstance:
}
