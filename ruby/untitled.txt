the internet: a wire
----------


light => router => electrical signal => pc
light => tower => electro magnetic waves => mobile

ICANN: monitors domain names and stuff

internet is infrastructure
web is service built ontop of that infrastructure

servers are coputers that contain website information

servers are connected DIRECTLY to the internet

clients are connected INDRECTLY through an ISP. my pc is a client

routers: where 2 or more parts of the internet intersect (10-15 needed to get to 1 website) everytime packets hit a router it adds a layer on the way to a server. on the way back, each layer is removed. this gaurentees it returns on the same path it took.

===================
DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) is a phone book of ip addresses => urls
long distance causes lags. this is LATENCY
optical fibers underwater

actually going to www.google.com.
that dot is the "root"

cache = memory
TLD = COM (Top Level Domain)
ANS authoritative name servers
