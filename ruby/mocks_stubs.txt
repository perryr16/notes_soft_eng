MOCKS AND STUBS
---------------

gem install mocha #(only once)
require 'mocha/minitest'

fake_object = mock('name') => #<Mock:name>
fake_object = mock		   => #<Mock:0xadf3rq45random>

object.stubs(:method).returns("desired result")
object.expects(:method).returns("desired result")
	will return error, if the method was never called

*doesnt even need to be a real method. When you call that fake method, it will return the retuns variable

only use mocks/stubs if the original object/behavior is working and tested

mocha respone when calling methods on mocks:
	> unexpected invocation: mock....

can stub on real objects too!
	
ex: 
	paint_1 = mock('paint 1')
    paint_1.stubs(:color).returns("Alizarin Crimson")
	#fake method
	paint_1.stubs(:not_real).returns("Titanium White")
	paint_2 = Paint.new("Van Dyke Brown")
	#fake method
	paint_2.stubs(:banana_sandwhich).returns("SHIBUYA")
	
	OUTPUT
	paint_1	
	=> #<Mock:paint 1>
	paint_1.color 
	=> "Alizarin Crimson"
	paint_1.not_real 
	=> "Titanium White"
	paint_2
	=> #<Paint:0x43r3aefa>
	paint_2.banana_sandwhich
	=>"SHIBUYA"
