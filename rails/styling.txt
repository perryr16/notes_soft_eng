HTML_CSS
=========
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
DOM - document object model (HTML PAGE)
<!DOCTYPE html> => use html 5
<html> # otherwise its a disastor
and ending tag </html>
<title>what the tab says</title>
<a></a> = Anchor tag

$ open file #will open the html file


SEMANTIC TAGS
<nav></nav> #navigation tag
<footer></footer>
<header></header>
<section></section> # same as div, but its semantic
<article></article> # small amounts of text thats bundled


class is mostly used (98%)
fine to use class="animal-1"
			class="animal-2"
id is good for nav and footer (things that exist only once)
	-submit button is *ok* too
	
block = goes across the whole screen (tetris)
<span> is an inline element
	gets put "inline" right next to
	
<%= yeild %> pulls the route view file

add <nav> to the application.html, but class="active" wont work
add anything that we want on EVERY PAGE ti application.html.erb
	
	
DONT MAKE STYLE CHNAGES INLINE: makes you look silly

application.css is a manifest file
no touching anything above line 15

this is a css rule:
selector {
	property:value;
}
h1 {
	color: blue;
}

naming convention: use "-"

ctrl+i is like pry. can make changes but they wont be saved to atom=======
