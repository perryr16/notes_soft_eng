GROUP BY << used with aggregate functions and SELECT
after WHERE 
before ORDER BY 
before LIMIT 

Ex
  SELECT year,
    AVG(imdb_rating)
  FROM movies
  GROUP BY year
  ORDER BY year;

is the same as 

  SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
  FROM movies
  WHERE year = 1999;
  
  SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
  FROM movies
  WHERE year = 2000;
  
  SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
  FROM movies
  WHERE year = 2001;

MULTI GROUP
  SELECT category, 
    price,
    AVG(downloads)
  FROM fake_apps
  GROUP BY 1, 2   <<<<<< 1 is first column, 2 is second column...
  ORDER BY 1 DESC, 2;
