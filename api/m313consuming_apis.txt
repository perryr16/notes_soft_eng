Ask yourself: 
is it free?
does it require authentication?
does it have what I need?
is there an example request?
is there an example response?

google 'free apis'
https://rapidapi.com/ for a catalogue of free apis that they integrate with

conn = Faraday.new(...)
or
conn = Faraday.get('https://api.github') do |faraday|
  faraday.headers['Authorization'] = 'token OAUTH-TOKEN'
end
*can use req (request) or faraday bc its a faraday object

GET USED TO CURL

AUTHORIZATION
headers will be listed in documentation with a `-H` and `:`

propublica
> curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "X-API-Key: PROPUBLICA_API_KEY"
==> faraday.headers['X-API-KEY'] = 'PROPUBLICA_API_KEY'

github
> curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com
==> faraday.headers['Authorization'] = 'token OAUTH-TOKEN'


FIGARO is responsible for the application.yml
FIGARO = RAILS
DOTENV = RUBY
hide your stuff here so people cant find it and then use it excessivly costing you money
tokens have an experiation
keys are good until I ask for a new one
