"learning fluency"

hebrew
italian in college

cantonese/mandarin

sweet revenge

chess player
no women at coding conference

softwater = 1/2 and 1/2
object orented code similar to chinese
good english = good documentation
its a puzzle
all the details matter
fluency is key

DISCIPRINE
TEAMWORK
understanding and respect for the work that came before

its tedious

work to bend the rules to be a little creative
discipline befor imagination

inovation is realized in heindisght

'the disregard of rote memorization is a failire of imaginaion

git staging
-better to do many small commits instaed of one big one.
-move 
allows you to concentrate on new changes

CODECADEMY GIT PRO
-red means they havent been added
-green means the have been added
-diff only works after add & before commit
	-i.e. git diff shows changes in the staging area
-its ok to have red files that arent going to be added.
-git add after each changee
-git commit - short, pressnt tense
SHA is the random code of each commit. this identifies the commit
VERSION CONTROL
git init
git status
