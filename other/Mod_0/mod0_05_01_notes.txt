array syntax = plural

separate your objects on each line

ITERATION
---------
a process of repeating a task for each object in a collection
 ex: grading papers
 	collection: papers
	task: grade

scenario: replacing tires
collection: tires
for each: tire
do this: take off tire, put tire on
then: repeat with next tire

scenario: wash dishes
collection: dishes
for each: dish
do this: clean dish, put in drying rack
then repeat with next dish

Iteration in Back End
EACH = for
ex:

numbers = [2, 6, 10, 15, 18, 23]

total_of_array = 0
numbers.each do |number|
  total_of_array += (number * 2)
  # or total_of_array = number  + total_of_array
end

total_of_array 

returns 148


puts = print to screen

ex: students = ["m", "j", "x", "a", "n"]

students.each do |student|
  puts "grading paper for #{student}"
  # or puts "grading paper for " + student
end


string interpolation :"string #{array}"
