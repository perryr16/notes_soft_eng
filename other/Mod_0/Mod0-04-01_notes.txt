dont include personal data in commits
---------------
TOP DOWN DESIGN:
An approach to breaking down problems into smaller easy problems

ABSTRACTION: Complexities are abstracted away. where an object performs a task without being concerend about how it is done.
-removing other objects that are irrelavent to the current process
-ex: I dont need to know how the mother board works to use a computer.
-hello.reverse : i dont need to know how the code works in order to implement it

ENCAPSULATION: Where an object handles its own internal staes and behind the scenes work. 
-Breaking things into smaller components
---------
OOP - Object Oriented Programming
try to model data with objects
RUBY, JAVASCRIPT are OOP languages
modeling the world by treating everything as an object

objects = instances
attributes contain data about an object
attributes usualyl named as nouns

is it an attribute?
will this data CHANGE? if so, not an attribute
is there any other data that underlines this piece of data?
ex: age is bad, age changers
birthdate is good, never changes

methods: behaviors, actions or calculations
usually verbs

return value: result of a method that performs a calculation
