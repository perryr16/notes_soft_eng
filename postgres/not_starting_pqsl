$ psql
psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start

or 

$ brew services restart postgresql
