use watch to make changes to computed values without using a value in a computed fxn 

These functions take two parameters: the new value of that property and the previous value of that property.
  function(new, old)

if possible, use computed.


const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    currentLanguage: 'Spanish',
    supportedLanguages: ['Spanish', 'Italian', 'Arabic'],
    hoursStudied: 274
  },
  watch: {
    currentLanguage: function (newCurrentLanguage, oldCurrentLanguage) {
      if (supportedLanguages.includes(newCurrentLanguage)) {
        this.hoursStudied = 0;
      } else {
        this.currentLanguage = oldCurrentLanguage;
      }
    }
  }
});
