MIXIN: a class containing methods that can be used by other classs without a need to inherit from it 

in JS you can only inherit from a single object 
there can only be one [[Prototype]]
a class can only extend one other class 


//mixin 
const sayHiMixin = {
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  }
  sayBye() {
    alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
  }
};

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);

new User('ross').sayHi(); 
//--> Hello ross
