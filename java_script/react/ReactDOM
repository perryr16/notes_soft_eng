ReactDOM is a react specific javascript library
===============================================
DOM = document object model 
    tree of objects (<head>, <body>)

USAGE
-----
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(<jsx_emelent_to_appear>, <jsx_element_to_be_appended_to>)

ReactDOM.render(<h1>hi</h1>, document.getElementById(<element_id>, document.getElementById(<id>))

NOTES
------
- only updates the DOM elements that have changed => double render wont effect anything
    - most js frameworks update the DOM more than they need to 
    - VIRTUAL DOM: for every DOM there is a corresponding virtual DOM > a lightweight copy 
        - a blue print, not the physical house 
    - DIFFING: comparing the DOM to the VIRTUAL DOM and updating based on DIFFERENCES
