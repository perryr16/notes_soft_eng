CONTROLLED VS UNCONTROLLED INPUTS 
UNCONTROLLED: maintains its own internal state 
CONTROLLED: does not maintain its own internal state (you'll have to go through props)
    * most react components are controlled 
    * <input value={...} />





=============
      <form
        action="#">
        <input 
          type="password"
          placeholder='Password'/>
        <input 
          type='submit'/>
      </form>
